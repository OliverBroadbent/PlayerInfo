# EntityInfo

Adds descriptions for player tags to help make edits quicker and more accurate. Enjoy :)

## Gamemode

Both `playerGameType` and `previousPlayerGameType` are converted into text with color to match.

## XP Tags Summary

Avoid confusion with these very handy descriptions for `Score`, `XpLevel`, `XpTotal`, and `XpP`.

## Food/Hunger Calculation

Simple calculation of `foodLevel` to show the value as seen in-game. Includes *"Full"*, *"Half-Full"*, and *"Starving"* statuses.

## Fall Damage Calculation

Takes the `FallDistance` value and turns it into the amount of damage you will receive on impact. *Note: this does **not** take into account any enchantments such as Feather Falling.*

## Other Tags

This extension also adds descriptions to many other tags, such as `LastDeathLocation`, `SleepTimer`, `Dimension` (Console/Bedrock ONLY), and player specific attributes for Bedrock.
